Unsatisfied with current situation is this a Delphi 5 port from the MongoDB's c-driver(version 1.3.4). It requires the 32bit compiled versions of libmongo.dll and mongoc.dll. Nearly untested and implements only and handful features/functions.

Currently missing parts:
* many function which i don't needed
* no bcon support


License:
Like the c-driver Apache 2.0.
